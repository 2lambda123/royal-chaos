# Chaos engineering systems invented at KTH Royal Institute of Technology

Every tool is organized as a separate folder in this repo, with a detailed README file inside. Here's the basic information:

## Chaos Machine
Chaos machine is a tool to do chaos engineering on the JVM level using bytecode. In particular, it concentrates on analyzing the error-handling ability of each try-catch block involved in the application.

More details in the Arxiv paper: [A Chaos Engineering System for Live Analysis and Falsification of Exception-handling in the JVM (Arxiv 1805.05246, 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05246)
