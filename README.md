Chaos machine is a tool to do chaos engineering on the JVM level using bytecode. In particular, it concentrates on analyzing the error-handling ability of each try-catch block involved in the application. It has two modules:

- Perturbation injector: injects a corresponding exception at a specific time  
- Chaos controller: controls every perturbation injector to fulfill a chaos experiment, generates analysis report for developers
