Open + D,Few to none,Normal and spike after,normal
Open + E,Very few,Increase and spike/normal after,Increased memory
Open + E + D,No requests,Normal/Fewer and spike after,Big increase memory for high delay
Write + D,-,-,normal
Write + E,-,-,normal
Write + E + D,-,-,normal
Writev + D,No requests,Fewer and spike after,Both CPU and Network IO is small during and spike after
Writev + E,No requests,Increased,Smaller Network IO. Increased CPU.
Writev + E + D,No requests,Normal and spike after,Both CPU and Network IO is small during and spike after
Read + D,No requests,Norma. EINTR fewer and spike after,Both CPU and Network IO is smaller and spike. EINTR tiny+spike for network IO{,} increased CPU + memory usage.
Read + E,No requests,Normal,Both CPU and Network IO is smaller.
Read + E + D,No requests,Normal{,} fewer+spike for higher delay,Both smaller or small/tiny+spike.

Poll + D,No requests,Normal to fewer and spike,Both CPU and Network IO is smaller and spike after.
Poll + E,No requests,Fewer and spike after,Same as above. 
Poll + E + D,No requests,Increased and spike after,Same as above. Huge memory usage
Select + D,No requests,Fewer and spike after,Both CPU and Network IO small and spike afte
Select + E,Crash,Except for EINTR{,} Futex/Newstat only during,Increased CPU usage and tiny network IO
Select + E + D,Crash,Very few{,} then none.,Crash after perturbation for EINTR
